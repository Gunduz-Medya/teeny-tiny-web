## ðŸ“Œ Introduction to SSR & SSG

In modern web development, **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** and **SSG (Static Site Generation)**  
are two key approaches for delivering content efficiently.

âœ… **SSR** = Render pages on request at runtime.  
âœ… **SSG** = Pre-generate pages at build time.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

With **SSR**, pages are generated **dynamically** on each request.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Rendering** | Happens on the server at request time. |
| **Performance** | Slower since pages are built on-demand. |
| **SEO** | Excellent, as pages are rendered before sending to the client. |
| **Use Case** | Dynamic content (e.g., dashboards, user-specific data). |

### **Example: SSR in Next.js**
```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  const data = await res.json();

  return { props: { data } };
}

export default function Page({ data }) {
  return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}
```

âœ… **SSR is best for pages that need up-to-date dynamic content.**  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. What is Static Site Generation (SSG)?

With **SSG**, pages are **pre-built** at build time and served statically.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Rendering** | Happens at build time (before deployment). |
| **Performance** | Fast, as pre-rendered pages are served from CDN. |
| **SEO** | Excellent, as HTML is generated in advance. |
| **Use Case** | Blogs, marketing sites, documentation. |

### **Example: SSG in Next.js**
```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  const data = await res.json();

  return { props: { data } };
}

export default function Page({ data }) {
  return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}
```

âœ… **SSG is best for content that doesnâ€™t change often.**  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Key Differences Between SSR & SSG

| Feature | SSR (Server-Side Rendering) | SSG (Static Site Generation) |
|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Rendering Time** | On request (real-time) | At build time (pre-rendered) |
| **Performance** | Slower (depends on server) | Faster (CDN cached) |
| **SEO** | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Use Case** | Dynamic content (e.g., user dashboards) | Static content (e.g., blogs, landing pages) |
| **Server Dependency** | Requires a running server | No server needed (static hosting) |

âœ… **SSR is for dynamic pages, while SSG is for pre-built static pages.**  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. When to Use SSR vs SSG?

| Scenario | Best Approach |
|----------|--------------|
| **Personalized Content** | âœ… SSR |
| **E-commerce (Live Prices & Stock)** | âœ… SSR |
| **Blogs & Documentation** | âœ… SSG |
| **Landing Pages & Marketing Sites** | âœ… SSG |
| **Real-Time Data (Dashboards, User Feeds)** | âœ… SSR |
| **SEO-Optimized Pages** | âœ… SSG or SSR |

âœ… **Choose SSR for dynamic updates, SSG for performance.**  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

- **SSR** is best for dynamic pages that change frequently.  
- **SSG** is best for static content that doesnâ€™t need real-time updates.  
- **Hybrid Approaches** (ISR - Incremental Static Regeneration) can combine both. ðŸš€
